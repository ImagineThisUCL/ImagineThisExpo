## Expo publish Docker container

This is a container for publishing apps generated by ImagineThis to Expo.

### ImagineThis server

First, make sure you fill in the `EXPO_TOKEN` environment variable in `expo-publish-script.sh`.

Then, make sure the image is built on ImagineThis server, by running:
```sh
docker build -t imaginethis-expo .
```

### Local development

In case you actually want to run this container and publish an app to Expo you will need to setup environment variables:
- PROJECT_NAME
- PROJECT_ID

And alos, you will need to mount a directory that contains the app's source code as a bind volume in `/usr/src/app`.

Both steps above can be achieved for example by the following command:
```sh
docker run -it -e PROJECT_NAME=testApplication -e PROJECT_ID=testID -v /ImagineThisBackend/OutputStorage/testID:/usr/src/app imaginethis-expo
```
